          Arunachal Pradesh is situated in the farthermost north-eastern border of India. The influence of tribal communities and nearby Himalayan civilisations is quite evident in the local cuisine. Rice and meat are the staple food of Arunachal. Lettuce is quite popular among locals and it is cooked using green chillies, coriander and ginger.
