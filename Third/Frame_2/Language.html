          Arunachal Pradesh is perhaps one of the most linguistically diverse states in Asia. More than 50 dialects of the Tibeto-Burman language structure can be observed here. Nyishi, Apatani, Bokar, Galo, Tagin, Adi are common languages which fall under the Tani dialect. Mishmi language is popular in the eastern part of the state. Digaru, Idu and Miju fall under mishmi and have been recognised as endangered languages.
